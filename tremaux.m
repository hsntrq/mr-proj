%   path = TREMAUX(map, start, finish) finds a path from the starting
%   position (start) to the finishing position (finish) on the given map.
%   The map is a 2D matrix where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a
%   wall. The start and finish positions are given as 1x2 arrays in the form
%   [row, column]. The function returns the path as a 2D matrix, where each
%   row represents a position on the map in the form [row, column].
