function path = tremaux(map, start, finish)
%TREMAUX Finds a path from start to finish using TrÃ©maux's algorithm
%   path = TREMAUX(map, start, finish) finds a path from the starting
%   position (start) to the finishing position (finish) on the given map.
%   The map is a 2D matrix where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a
%   wall. The start and finish positions are given as 1x2 arrays in the form
%   [row, column]. The function returns the path as a 2D matrix, where each
%   row represents a position on the map in the form [row, column].

% Initialize the path with the starting position
path = start;

% Initialize the directions we can move (right, left, down, up)
directions = [1, 0; -1, 0; 0, 1; 0, -1];

% Initialize the marks array to keep track of which entrances have been marked
[m, n] = size(map);
marks = zeros(m, n);

% While the current position is not the finishing position
while ~isequal(path(end,:), finish)
    % Find the valid moves from the current position (up, down, left, right)
