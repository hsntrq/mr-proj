# There are 3 releases of the project.

In v1.1, you can run the sol.m file to run different algorithms, i.e. wall follower, random mouse, back track, pledge, tremaux on different maps.
--------------

It runs on binary occupancy grid maps where 1 represents a wall and 0 represents free wall.

In v1.2, you can run code/MazeSolving.m to run on different algorithms, i.e. random mouse, back track, and tremaux on 3 different copellia scenes.
--------------

It runs on an occupancy grid map where each cell represents the edges of the cell in the form 0bwxyz {w:left, x:right, y:up, z:down}.

In v1.3 we have added mazeplotter.m which can then be used to plot the explored path as well.

Note: please ignore backtrack.m, instead use back_track.m in all different releases
