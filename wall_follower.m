function path = wall_follower(map, start, finish)
%WALL_FOLLOWER Finds a path from start to finish using the wall follower algorithm
%   path = WALL_FOLLOWER(map, start, finish) finds a path from the starting
%   position (start) to the finishing position (finish) on the given map.
%   The map is a 2D matrix where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a
%   wall. The start and finish positions are given as 1x2 arrays in the form
%   [row, column]. The function returns the path as a 2D matrix, where each
%   row represents a position on the map in the form [row, column].

% Initialize the path with the starting position
path = start;

% Set the initial direction to face the finish position
if start(1) < finish(1)
    direction = [1, 0]; % facing down
elseif start(1) > finish(1)
    direction = [-1, 0]; % facing up
elseif start(2) < finish(2)
    direction = [0, 1]; % facing right
elseif start(2) > finish(2)
    direction = [0, -1]; % facing left
end
